# CSC 111 Final Project: Wake Forest Theatre
Learning objectives: Understand object-oriented design from start to finish

## Requirements
1. You will need a base class file. Your base class MUST contain the following:
- A minimum of 3 field variables
- A minimum of 3 constructors
- All relevant get / set methods for each of your field variables
- Some sort of print method
- A method that calls a method
- A method that uses this.
- A minimum of 3 additional useful methods (not print)
2. You will need an extended class file. Your extended class MUST contain the following:
- A minimum of 2 additional field variables
- A minimum of 1 additional constructor
- All relevant get / set methods for each of your field variables
- A method that uses super. (You must use this in another way than in a print method. If you use this in a print method, it does not count).
- A minimum of 2 additional useful methods
3. You will need a program class file. For this program, you need to use your ALL of your methods in a creative way. Tell a story, involve the user or do something to make it interesting. Points will be given for creativity in addition to functionality, readability and efficiency.
4. Additionally, somewhere in your code (in any combination of the 3 files) you should also make use of the following:
- A for or while loop
- If / else statements
- Arrays
- A minimum of 3 different variable types
